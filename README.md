When you love who you are,you become a conduit of light.Just drop into your heart space,and live life from this view.For all of this doing is not who you are.Listen to your heartâ€™s soft whisper,this voice will show you the way.Live life from your essence is what she will say.See the light in yourself,and your world will be bright.There is no need to worry,you are exactly as you should be;remember to love who you are,and love you will see.
